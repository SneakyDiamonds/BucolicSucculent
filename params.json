Then share with your friends and delight in visiting each spot while exploring your city. Players can see a list of points on the map and plan their own routes. The first player to visit all the places is the winner! Individual players can view their statistics from past games.\r\n\r\n### Fresh Air!\r\nSitting is the new smoking and most web-based games require the player to sit at their computer. This is unhealthy! When you play Scvng.it, you must get off the couch if you want to win. Since players can strategize their own routes, they can decide the optimal path to victory.\r\n\r\n### From our founder:\r\nScvng.it is the next step in location based interactive experiences. The future is now!  -Sam Cheung\r\n\r\n### The verdict is in:\r\nThis game is great! I've been playing for about a month now and feel healthier and happier.  -Brian Kilrain\r\n\r\n### Shia knows...\r\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"oiY2JlF\"><a href=\"//imgur.com/oiY2JlF\">What are you waiting for?
