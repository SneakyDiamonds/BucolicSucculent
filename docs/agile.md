THE SCRUM TEAM

    The Development Team : Derek Liu, Sam Cheung, Brian Kilrain, Clara McKenzie
    The Scrum Master : Clara McKenzie

THE SPRINT: SCRUM EVENTS
  Sprints consisted of three distinct meeting types.  Sprint duration was from two to four days in length. We completed four sprints.
    Sprint Planning
    Held at the start of each sprint. Team selects tasks for inclusion and 
    votes on the number of points assigned.

    Daily Scrum
    Held daily or bi-daily. Team members report what they have completed, any blocking or 
    gating issues, and what they plan to work on next.
    
    Sprint Review and Retrospective
    At the end of each sprint we had a sprint review and retrospective.  
    Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how 
    those problems were solved and answered questions about the work.

    Scrum Artifacts
    We created a Trello Board with two lists for each Sprint, one for tickets in the Sprint and one for done tickets. 
    A ticket could be for a feature, a bug, we also created tickets to list PRs in the Sprint.  We created lists for the 
    Backlog for tickets waiting to be added to a Sprint, and a Bug Report list ro track items that came up after the 
    Sprint planning and could be worked on. Sprint velocity was
